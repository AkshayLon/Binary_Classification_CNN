# Binary_Classification_CNN
Developed a convolutional neural network to classify a set of MRI scans of the brain and detect the presence of a tumour.
The images can be found in the brain_tumor directory and the configuration of the model can be found in model_implementation.py.
To train the model and test it out on the validation set, run main.py.
